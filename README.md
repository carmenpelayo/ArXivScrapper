# Tracking the Evolution of Science Worldwide

This repository contains Python code to **analyze the evolution of science worldwide** by counting monthly publications in different arXiv knowledge categories. 

[ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/) is an open-access online preprint repository covering a wide range of disciplines, including physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, statistics, quantitative finance, and more. As one of the most important platforms for the early dissemination of research results, arXiv is considered a reliable indicator of global scientific progress.

The volume of publications on arXiv reflects not only growth in certain areas of knowledge but also emerging trends in science and technology, making it a reliable barometer for measuring the impact and development of research.

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to provide Python code that enables the user to easily extract time series of monthly volume of publications in different [arXiv categories](https://arxiv.org/category_taxonomy), which represent the evolution of  science globally. These series allow to identify trends, growth patterns, and emerging research areas, providing a valuable database for scientific and strategic analysis.

## Methodology

The project's methodology focuses on:

1. **URL Generation**: Automatically constructing monthly URLs (e.g. `https://arxiv.org/list/cs.AI/2000-04` for AI papers in April 2000) for selected arXiv categories, from a specified start year to an end year.
   
2. **Web Scraping**: Using Python libraries such as `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`, the monthly publication counts available on the corresponding page for each category are extracted.
   
3. **Data Storage**: The collected data is organized into time series with clear identifiers by month and category.

4. **Analysis and Visualization** (optional): The extracted data can be used to generate graphs and models analyzing the behavior of scientific production over time.

## Potential Applications

This project has a wide range of applications:

1. **Econometric Models**: Integrating arXiv time series into econometric models to study the impact of research on the global economy.

2. **Strategic Vision**: Providing academic institutions and research organizations with a tool to identify emerging areas and set priorities.

3. **Trend Monitoring**: Monitoring specific disciplines to evaluate the progress of science and technology quantitatively.

4. **Impact of Scientific Policies**: Analyzing the effect of governmental or private initiatives on the volume of scientific publications.

5. **Visualization of the Scientific Ecosystem**: Creating interactive dashboards for exploring data by category and time period.

## Final Considerations

1. **Scraping Limitations**: Scraping is limited by the availability of data on arXiv and the platform's usage policies. It is recommended not to make excessive requests in a short period.

2. **Extensibility**: This project can be expanded to include more categories, longer time intervals, or integration with other data sources.

3. **Collaboration**: Other developers and researchers are invited to contribute improvements to the code or additional analyses.
